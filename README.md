# setWatermarker
a node preject for setting watermarker by FFmpeg

#### Necessary operation
you must download FFmpeg from http://ffmpeg.org/download.html
then set your system environment variable.
I just run it on windows. so,sorry about who use linux or ios.

on windows, add [FFmpeg_Path]/bin in path, just like 'E:\ffmpeg\bin;'

then run 'npm start' in your powershell.
